# BarcodeScanner
Simple iOS barcode scanner in swift

This is a demo project for a barcode scanner in Swift, tested on iPhone 6c iOS 9.3

The Toggle scanner button toggles the scanner. When the scanner is active, recognized barcodes wil be identified by a yellow marker. Touching the (active) scanner view for more than .3 seconds captures the first barcode recognized. When a barcode is captured, the scanner is stopped and the barcode data is shown. Tapping the scanner view restarts the scanner.
